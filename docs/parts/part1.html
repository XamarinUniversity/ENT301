        <h2>Goals</h2>        
        <p>
	        The goal of this lab is to register with Salesforce for a 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=overview_de.htm">
			Developer Edition Environment</a> account. 
			The registration process will automatically create several 
			<a target="_blank" href="http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/Content/sforce_api_objects_list.htm">Standard Objects</a> 
			(i.e. tables) and populate
			many of them with sample data; you will use the Salesforce web interface to explore this data.
        </p>

        <!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <p>
            Below are the step-by-step instructions to implement the exercise.
        </p>

        <h2>Register for an account</h2>
        <p>
			Here you will register for a Salesforce account.  
			Note that the email address you use during registration becomes your Salesforce
			username. It is difficult to delete a Salesforce account/username once created so you
			might want to use a secondary email address to register while you are learning.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
				Open a web browser and navigate to the
				<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.salesforce.com/signup">registration page</a>.
            </li>

			<li>
				Complete the registration form.
			</li>
			<li>
				Check your email for the Salesforce confirmation message. Click the link in the email
				to complete the registration process.
			</li>
			<li>
				Record your username and password for future use.
			</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Examine the data in your account</h2>
        <p>
			Your goal is to work with the sample data that was automatically incorporated into your
			Environment when you registered for your account. You will view the records in an Object,
			modify the data in an existing record, and create a new record.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
				Open a web browser and <a target="_blank" href="https://login.salesforce.com">login</a> to
				your Salesforce account.
            </li>

			<li>	
				After login, you should be on the <strong>Setup</strong> page. This page contains the main navigation
				links in the left-hand column. In the upper-right corner of the page header there should be a link
				labeled "Setup" that you can use to return to this page from anywhere in your account.
            </li>

			<li>
				The upper-right corner of the page header also contains the <strong>App Menu</strong>.
				By default, you are likely viewing the <strong>Sales</strong> app. If you are not, 
				select the <strong>Sales</strong> app from the menu.				
			</li>

			<li>
				You should see a list of tabs arranged across the top of the main content area.
				Click on the <strong>Accounts</strong> tab. This tab provides a web UI for the
				Standard Object named <strong>Account</strong>, it was automatically created
				and populated with sample data when you registered with Salesforce. Note that
				"account" here means "customer" and not "user".
			</li>

			<li>
				Use the drop-down list at the top of the Account page to select and view "All Accounts".	 
			</li>

			<li>
				[Optional] Edit an account of your choice (e.g. change the number of employees). Save your changes.
			</li>

			<li>
				[Optional] Click the <strong>New Account</strong> button near the top of the page to add a new record
				to the <strong>Account</strong> Object. Be sure to assign a value to the required
				<strong>Account Name</strong> field (the other fields are optional).
				Each record also has an <strong>Id</strong> that will act as the primary key.
				The <strong>Id</strong> value is generated automatically and is not shown in the web interface.
				Save your changes and then select the "All Accounts" view again to verify your new record is there.
			</li>

			<li>
				[Optional] If you have time, continue to explore the Standard Objects. The <strong>Contacts</strong>
				and <strong>Products</strong> objects both contain sample data.
			</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
			In this exercise, you registered with Salesforce and explored the data in your Environment.
			The Standard Objects and sample data help you get started as a developer since the table
			and field names are all standardized. This makes it easy to find sample code and discussions
			online because many other developers have written code to access that same data.
        </p>
